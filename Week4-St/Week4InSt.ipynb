    "A time series is considered non-stationary when it exhibits a discernible trend, which can be analyzed and modeled. Once this trend is accurately represented, it can be eliminated from the time series data, a process referred to as detrending. When a dataset either lacks a trend initially or has had its trend successfully removed, it is described as being in a trend-stationary state."

    "\n",
    "Constant Mean and Variance: In a stationary time series (i.e., a time series with no trend or seasonality), the mean and variance of the residuals should be approximately constant over time. If the mean and variance exhibit clear patterns or fluctuations, it suggests the presence of seasonality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Diagnostic Plots: Plotting the mean and standard deviation of residuals over time can reveal any systematic changes or patterns. Specifically, if you observe regular, repeating fluctuations in these plots, it's an indication that seasonality might be present in the data. The mean plot can help detect any shifts in the average value, while the standard deviation plot can show changes in the dispersion of data points.\n",
